#Living styleguide
Product: https://hackshackshacks.github.io/cssttr

This is my living styleguide. The goal of this project is to practice old and new CSS techniques. I want to challenge myself to solve problems that I would usually solve with Javascript with pure CSS instead. It's also important that the website is accessible to people without a mouse. 

I have designed and created 4 pages: login, chat, gallery and checkout.
