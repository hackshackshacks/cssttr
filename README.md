This is my living styleguide. The goal of this project is to practice old and new CSS techniques. I want to challenge myself to solve problems that I would usually solve with Javascript with pure CSS instead. It's also important that the website is accessible to people without a mouse. 

So far I've designed and created 4 pages: login, chat, gallery and checkout.
Todo:
- [ ] clean up code
- [ ] check browsers (i.e, safari)
- [ ] convert gallery to single grid
- [ ] extra page to hold Lea Verou samples
